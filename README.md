# Alexnet-Tensorflow
Created this code for my M.Sc. research project

# Alexnet
ALexnet Convulutional Neural Network architecture is implemented using Tensorflow (version: 2.4.0) and Keras 
Used on CIFAR 10 Dataset (32*32 dimension) with 3 chanels (RGB)
Sequential Model is used
5 convulutional layers and 3 dense layers are implemented

   # Data Preprocessing
   From 50,000 training set, 5,000 data are selected for validation test
   10,000 data are used for testing purpose
   Data Augmentation is implemented
   
 Accuracy Matrix and Loss Matrix are implemented
 Confusion matrix with Normalization is also shown
